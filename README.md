# CS230 Express Skeleton

This is a skeleton express app based on the structure generated by the official express generator. I have, however, changed the type from commonjs to module so that including other scripts is universal between front end and back end, meaning express will behave like express and public javascript files and use import instead of require.

I have also replaced all references to the var keyword with const.
